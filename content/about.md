# About Me

## Projects
__Homelab__\
*August 2025*
- Deployed and configured OPNsense as the main router and firewall, setting up VLANs, appropriate subnets, DHCP, and firewall rules to segment and secure homelab traffic.
- Used Proxmox to host virtual machines for labs and services, learning virtualization, resource allocation, and snapshot managementâ€”accomplished utilizing LXC containers and KVM virtual machines.
- Created a SOC lab environment using Kali Linux for vulnerability assessment, a Windows target for exploitation, and the Wazuh stack for real-time detection and prevention.
- Deployed a hardened VPS with a Wireguard VPN tunnel to securely expose internal services to the internet without port forwarding or local ports.
- Hardened the VPS with SSH public key authentication, DNS hardening, strict iptables rules, Nginx security headers and rate limiting, and web firewall protections.
